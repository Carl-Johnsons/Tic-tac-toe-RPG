# Normal Mode:
- The game is played on a 3x3 (or more) grid board.
- One player uses X and the other uses O.
- The players take turns placing their symbol on an empty square on the board.
- The first player to get three (depending on the grid board) of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
# RPG Mode:
- It's the same as normal Tic Tac Toe but it has some new features:
  + The game is played on a 18x32 grid board.
  + Each player has 3 HP and one random skill at the beginning.
  + The first player to get five of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) make the opponent's HP reduced.
